# FEMRockPaperScissors
Front End Mentor Project

This project is a Front End Mentor challenge. 
It was a lot more challenging than I expected. 
I know I could have done many things differently,
but overall I'm happy with the outcome.
If you come across this project and want to give me feedback,
I'm happy to receive it.
