Front End Mentor Project

This project is a Front End Mentor challenge.  
I could have done many things a bit differently,
but overall I'm happy with the outcome.
If you come across this project and want to give me feedback,
I'm happy to receive it.

Issues:
  - At the end of the game, the score resets, 
    but you can't tell until you start the game over 
    and click on a circle. The score then resets to 12 
    or 11 if the circle you click on, causes you to lose that hand.
